Venv vs PipEnv?!
	venv looks a little nicer to work with!

This is just such a mess, it makes me want to explore different programming languages!
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe
	like seriously what a mess!
	I especially like that venv is the official way that was supposed to replace vitualenv, but yet pipenv (endorsed as the official way) uses virtualenv
		I guess this is simply down to virtualenv being more popular, and the fact that it can be used in python 3 and 2...
	- venv is the built in standard library, so I guess this is supposed to be the "new" way of managing virtual environments
